Recaf is an open-source framework for authoring extensions for Java. It transforms code at compile time with a transparent set of rules and defines a set of runtime classes that can be used to override Java either at the statement or even at the expression level.

### Tests

```shell
> git clone git@github.com:cwi-swat/recaf.git
> cd recaf
> ./testgen # or testnogen to skip generation
```
